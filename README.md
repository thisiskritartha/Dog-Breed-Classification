# Dog Breed Classification using Convolution Neural Network

A Flutter Mobile Application to classify the 72 Dogs Breed(including Himalayan Sheepdog i.e., Bhote Kukur).

## Introduction
Dog breed classification is a challenging task due to the wide variety of dog breeds with subtle differences in appearance. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable performance in image classification tasks, making them an ideal choice for dog breed recognition. In this project, we propose a CNN-based approach for dog breed classification.

## Objective
•	Breed Classification
•	Real-Time Classification
•	Offline Functionality

## Output and Analysis
The screenshot of output through the gallery and live feeds are given as below. The Application predicts the breed along with the accuracy level in percentage as shown below.
